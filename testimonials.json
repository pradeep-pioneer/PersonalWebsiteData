      "recommendation": "Pradeep is the most techie guy i have come across in my entire career. He has this do or die attitude which ensures complete success of any project he takes. His approach is systematic and technical. He is not only intelligent but also very hardworking and can work tirelessly and the time frame looses its significance. He never says NO but finds ways and means to accomplish the task assigned to him. He's been very quick to understand the business requirements and convert these requirements into technical speak and get it implemented. Working with Pradeep was a pleasure. I would wish Pradeep all the very best for all his future endeavours."
