His approach is systematic and technical. He is not only intelligent but also very hardworking and can work tirelessly and the time frame looses its significance. He never says NO but finds ways and means to accomplish the task assigned to him. He's been very quick to understand the business requirements and convert these requirements into technical speak and get it implemented. Working with Pradeep was a pleasure. I would wish Pradeep all the very best for all his future endeavours."

I had the pleasure of working with Pradeep for almost three years at the Veridic Technologies, collaborating on several project teams. He has been really a great hand in  programming and was always keen to work on latest technologies. Pradeep's ability to handle or design any project was unlike any Iâ€™ve seen before and is really a dramatic increase in the productivity level for any company. No matter how difficult the situation is, I have seen him thriving always with a positive mindset. Not to mention, his ability to communicate with the business sponsors has always been outstanding. I would wish him all the best for his future and keep on exploring the new world!!"
